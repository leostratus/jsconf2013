## HEY FRIEND

Thanks for coming to check out my slide deck. 

Special thanks to @glenmaddern. I was inspired by his talk at:

http://geelen.github.io/web-directions-talk/

... and you can clearly see that I've borrowed so very much from its awesomeness.

Type is Alegreya for fancy bylines and Tauri all uppercase for everything else.

Apologies that I don't know the source of all the gifs and images I used. I found them scattered across Imgur and all sorts of animation-aggregate tumblrs with technology themes. Thanks to you, if you made one of them. <3

Cheers,

- Angelina
